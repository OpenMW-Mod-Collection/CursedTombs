# Cursed Tombs (OpenMW)

Grave robbing won't be as free anymore. Or did you think ancestors were such simpletons?

*For MWSE alternative, check out [Sepulchral Curses](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48332) by inpv.*

Interacting with tomb/barrow/etc containers now will have a chance to summon undead revenants behind you. They are unleveled by default, so prepare some enchanted weapons and restore strength spells. Keep in mind, that they may not come alone.

Sure, your swift fingers and lucky star might help you a little, but the odds of getting cursed are never zero.

And don't worry, only tomb containers are cursed - ancestors are indifferent to chests and sacks taken to them by other people.
